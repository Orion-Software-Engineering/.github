# ✨ Orion Software Engineering Project: Orion Meet ✨
This project aims to develop a matchmaking app for people to find and make friends with their interests in mind.
<br><br>

## 📃 Requirements Engineering

### 👨‍👧‍👦 Stakeholders
<ul>
  <li>Individual users finding matches</li>
  <li>Event Organizers</li>
  <li>Community Leaders</li>
</ul>

<h4>🤔 Who is behind the request for the work?</h4>
Ans: The team chose this project to improve upon already existing matchmaking solutions to widen the benefit. A major issue with existing solutions is that they usually consider only mutual friends and fail to connect people based on their interests.
<br>

<h4>🧐 Who would use the solutions?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals, to find friends and events of interest to them to attend.</li>
  <li>Event Organizers, to advertise events.</li>
</ul>

<h4>🤑 Economic benefits?</h4>
There is no direct economic benefit for the team at the moment, but event organisers would make more money if their patronage increases.
<br>
<h4>👻 Survey</h4>
For our data collection, <a href="https://forms.gle/NPpSH2zEeW95dUQ27">this google form</a> was created to get inputs from potential users. The data helped in determining the viability of our project and the potential market for our product.

## 😱 Orion Meet Features

The features that have been agreed to be implemented in this application were carefully tailored to meet the expectations of our potential stakeholders based on the following data:
<ol>
  <li>Data collected from potential stakeholders </li>
  <li>Personal recomendations from the internal team of Orion Meet.</li>
</ol>

This data was collected overtime through P2P conversations with potential stakeholder and also through a survey. 
The results of the survey is in the excel file below.<br>
[Survey_results_first50.csv](https://github.com/Orion-Software-Engineering/.github-private/files/9193570/Survey_results_first50.csv)

This file also gives a graphical representation of the results from the survey:<br>
